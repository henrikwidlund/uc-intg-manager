# Unfolded Circle Integration Manager

A web-based integration manager for [Unfolded Circle Remote Two/3](https://www.unfoldedcircle.com/). This integration provides a convenient web interface to manage your custom integrations, automatically check for updates, install new integrations, and backup integration config files. And it runs directly on your remote.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install on Remote

1. Download the latest release archive (`.tar.gz`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/JackJPowell/uc-intg-manager/releases) page
2. Upload and install via the Web Configurator:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Integrations & Docks** → **Custom Integrations**
   - Click **Upload** and select the downloaded archive
3. Configure the integration:
   - The integration will automatically discover your Remote using mDNS
   - **Web Configurator PIN**: Enter the PIN from Settings → Profile → Web Configurator
   - If discovery fails, you'll be prompted to manually enter:
     - **IP Address**: Your Remote's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
     - **Web Configurator PIN**: The PIN from Settings → Profile → Web Configurator
   - Note: The PIN is only required during initial setup. An API key will be created and used for subsequent authentication.
4. Access the web interface at `http://<remote-ip>:9999` when docked

### Option 2: Run in Docker

You can run the Integration Manager as a Docker container on an external server to manage your Remote.

#### Using docker run

```bash
docker run -d \\
  --name uc-intg-manager \\
  --network host \\
  -e UC_INTG_MANAGER_HTTP_PORT=9999 \\
  -e UC_CONFIG_HOME=/config \\
  -v uc-intg-manager:/config \\
  ghcr.io/jackjpowell/uc-intg-manager:latest
```

#### Using docker-compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  uc-intg-manager:
    image: ghcr.io/jackjpowell/uc-intg-manager:latest
    container_name: uc-intg-manager
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - UC_INTG_MANAGER_HTTP_PORT=9999
      - UC_CONFIG_HOME=/config
    volumes:
      - ./uc-intg-manager:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `UC_INTG_MANAGER_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP port for Integration Manager Web Server | `9999` | No|
| `UC_CONFIG_HOME` | Configuration directory path | `/config` | No |
| `UC_INTG_MANAGER_EXTERNAL` | Force external/Docker mode. **Enable** with `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` (case-insensitive, whitespace ignored). **Any other value** — including empty string, `0`, `false`, `no`, `off`, or a typo — disables external mode. When the variable is unset entirely, mode is inferred from `UC_CONFIG_HOME` (unset → external; starts with `/config` → external; otherwise on-remote). | Docker: `1`, others: manual | No |
| `UC_INTEGRATION_INTERFACE` | Network interface to bind integration API | `0.0.0.0` | No |
| `UC_INTEGRATION_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP port for integration API | `9090` | No |
